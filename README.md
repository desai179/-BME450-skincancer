## Project decription
We plan to use the ISIC 2016 Skin Cancer dataset. The dataset contains two different types of skin cancer (malignant and benign). The images were collected from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) archive. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set. For our project, we will use the dataset to train and evaluate machine learning models for skin cancer classification. We want to develop a method for image processing for skin cancer detection and diagnosis.
